# Pizza-Sales-Project
This project analyzes a full year (Jan–Dec 2015) of pizza sales data to uncover revenue drivers, ordering behavior, top/bottom sellers, and category/size performance. SQL was used for data extraction and KPI computation, while Power BI was used to design an interactive dashboard.
